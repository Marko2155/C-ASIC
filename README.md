# C#ASIC
C#ASIC (had to remove the # from title because of GitHub) is a program where you can write and run code in a BASIC-like programming language (fittingly) named C#ASIC (pronounced CBASIC).

# How it works
C#ASIC is not a real language, it is written all in software to point to standard C# functions (hence the name C#ASIC). C#ASIC will halt if it finds a command that is not programmed in yet.
C#ASIC works almost excatly like my other CLI program, .OS, but has some changes.

# How to install
Follow Microsoft's guide for installing .NET.
